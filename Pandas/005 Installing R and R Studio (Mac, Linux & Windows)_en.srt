00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,012
Instructor: Hello my friends,

2
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:02,400
welcome to this new tutorial.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,780
In this one I'm gonna show you

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,930
how to install R and RStudio on your machine.

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,800
All right, so let's do this.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,180
We have to start with R.

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,810
So, here in the search bar we're gonna type C-R-A-N,

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,570
press enter, and we're gonna click the first link

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,270
of the Comprehensive R Archive Network,

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,660
because that's exactly where we can download and install R

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,900
for the three systems: Linux, macOS, and Windows.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,210
So, let me show you quickly how to do it for the three,

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,550
starting with Linux. Download R for Linux.

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,920
So here, make sure to choose your Linux system.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,350
For example, I'm gonna show this to you for Ubuntu,

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,870
and then you simply need to follow the instructions here.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,000
So, you open your Linux terminal,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,730
then you're gonna enter these four command lines,

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,460
after which you will run this command line

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,580
to install R and its dependencies, and that's it.

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,050
That's all you need to do on Linux.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,450
You just install R by running these commands.

23
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,460
All right, so now let me show you

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,680
how to do this for Windows.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,780
For Windows, I recommend to click "base" here

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,280
because this is the easy option

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,470
if you want to install R for the first time.

28
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,420
So, let's do this. Let's choose this one.

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,310
And then you simply click this link

30
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,020
to install the latest R version.

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,480
You might get a different one when you take this tutorial.

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,020
At the time I'm speaking it is 4.2.2, all right?

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,180
I'm on a Mac, so I'm not gonna download here,

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,440
and well, speaking of Mac,

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm gonna show you now how to download R for macOS.

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
So, we click this link here,

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,220
then we're gonna take the latest release again,

38
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,130
and then make sure here to select the right PKG file

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,050
according to your macOS system.

40
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,630
So, for macOS 11 Big Sur and higher,

41
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,660
Apple silicon arm64, this is what you want,

42
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,570
and then for macOS 10.13 High Sierra and higher,

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,460
Intel 64-bit, this is what you want.

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,400
So, as far as I'm concerned, I'm in this case,

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,350
and so I'm gonna click this link

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,350
to download the version 4.2.2 of R,

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,680
and so I'm gonna click "save," and this will download R.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,450
There we go, it was very fast.

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,360
So, now I'm gonna go to my Downloads folder,

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm gonna double click it,

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,160
and then we're just gonna click "continue" here

52
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,740
to install R on our machine.

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,860
Agree and install. There we go.

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,890
And now it is installing R, and perfect.

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,169
Installation was successful. Great.

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,300
So, now you have R on your machine.

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,730
That's great, but we want an easy interface,

58
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,820
you know, a very user friendly interface when coding with R

59
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,730
and that's why it's also very good to install RStudio.

60
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,130
So, we're gonna go back to our favorite browser

61
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,690
and this time we're gonna enter RStudio. There we go.

62
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,090
RStudio, you click the first link

63
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,770
and you're gonna download RStudio,

64
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,360
so let's click this link first.

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,510
There we go, the RStudio ID, that's exactly what we want,

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,790
and we're gonna take the RStudio desktop.

67
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,190
So, let's click "Download RStudio" again,

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,230
and let's scroll down and let's find

69
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,910
the right one for our system.

70
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,200
So, download and install R,

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,970
We've already done it on CRAN,

72
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,640
and if you scroll down you will find RStudio

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,110
for your system.

74
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,870
Alright, Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, Ubuntu 22,

75
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,460
and some more below.

76
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,650
Okay, so here I'm on a Mac,

77
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,820
so again, I'm gonna take this one then save.

78
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,490
Done. So, now I'm gonna go back to my download folder,

79
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,710
I'm gonna double click this one now,

80
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,690
I'm gonna put it in my applications,

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,350
and in a second I will have RStudio installed on my machine.

82
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,110
So, let's close this, and now let's open RStudio

83
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,880
and let me introduce you to it.

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,730
So, I'm gonna find it right here.

85
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,880
Open and welcome to RStudio.

86
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,900
All right, so first we can see

87
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,540
that RStudio is divided into three panels.

88
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,580
This panel here, which is the console

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,350
where you can execute some code,

90
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,050
like for example, two plus two and press "Enter."

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,150
Then, this is the environment panel

92
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,850
where the variables of your code will be created

93
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,170
when you execute it,

94
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,750
and then the third panel here, which is your files,

95
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,010
you know, from your computer,

96
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,290
where you can access your codes and your data set.

97
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,090
So, for example, let's go to my desktop

98
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,830
where I have the whole Machine Learning A to Z

99
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,410
Codes and Datasets folder, and let's enter it.

100
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,600
Let's take, for example, Part 2 - Regression

101
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,150
and the simplest model, Simple Linear Regression,

102
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,920
and then the R folder.

103
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,180
So, here you can find the code

104
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,850
of the Simple Linear Regression model, the R code, right?

105
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,550
And then the dataset Salary_Data.csv.

106
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,670
So, to open the model, you simply click on it.

107
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,860
It will appear here in a fourth panel

108
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,340
where you can edit the code in this R file, right?

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,300
So now, just for fun,

110
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,269
just to give us an exciting introductory note on R,

111
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,000
let's execute this code, but before we execute it,

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,070
the first thing we always have to do

113
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,700
is to set this folder as working directory folder

114
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,150
so that when we import the data set here

115
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,640
while the console knows where to access it,

116
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,780
which is in this folder,

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,480
and so to set this folder as working directory,

118
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,950
we simply click "More" here

119
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,170
and then set as working directory.

120
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,360
There we go, and now we can simply

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,120
select the whole code here and then press Command

122
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,050
or Control+Enter to execute it, and there we go.

123
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,990
As you can see now, the code is executing in the console

124
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,160
and soon enough we can see our variables in the environment,

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,140
all the variables that are in this code,

126
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,910
and the two plots of the training set and the test set.

127
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,150
Of course, all these steps will be explained in details

128
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,310
when we implement the Simple Linear Regression model.

129
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,670
This was just a teaser of what we're gonna do in R,

130
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,720
and speaking of which,

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,980
I'll look forward to seeing you

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,190
in the next Practical Activities on Python and R

133
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,050
to implement R models,

134
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,273
and until then, enjoy machine learning.
